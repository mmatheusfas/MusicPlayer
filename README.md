# App Musicplayer

A Flutter project.

## Description

The idea was to make a symplified copy of Spotify. To use the app you have to make a account and do the login, after that you are in the home page where you have the radios, the genres and the search field. You can click on a radio and the see the musics or you can search for the music or artist that you whant to listen, on the player page you can play and pause the music and add the music on your favorites list. You have also the favorites page where you can click on the music and listen and you can remove the music from your favorites too. I decided to do a music player to work for the first time with playing audios and with Firebase. The project was all thought to work pretty good with Firebase, the login, registration and favorites part is where Firebase is working. I decided to use MobX becuase the favorites is a list that needs to update every time that a new music is add to favorites, so because of that I used the Observable List to do what I wanted. I used GetIt to do the indepency injection, I like GetIt because it's s symple and objective and work pretty good in small projects.
